# FocusNet: Bio-Inspired Visual Attention Networks for Medical Image Analysis

Official implementation of "FocusNet: A Bio-Inspired Deep Learning Architecture for Medical Image Analysis" (Nature, 2025).

## Overview

FocusNet is a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates biological vision principles for enhanced medical image analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple medical imaging modalities while maintaining biological plausibility.

### Key Features
- **Bio-inspired Architecture**: 
  - Magnocellular (M), Parvocellular (P), and Koniocellular (K) pathways mimicking the human visual system
  - Dynamic visual attention mechanism inspired by human saccadic movements
  - Predictive coding with GRU-based temporal integration
  
- **Multi-modal Support**:
  - 2D imaging: X-rays, histopathology, dermatology
  - 3D volumes: CT, MRI, ultrasound
  - Handles both single-label and multi-label classification tasks

- **Performance**:
  - State-of-the-art accuracy on MedMNIST benchmark
  - Enhanced interpretability through attention visualization
  - Efficient inference with selective attention

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/salilp42/FOCUS.git
cd FOCUS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from focusnet import EnhancedFocusNet2D

# Create model for 2D medical images
model = EnhancedFocusNet2D(
    in_channels=1,      # Single channel (e.g., X-ray)
    num_classes=10,     # Number of diagnostic classes
    num_saccades=2      # Number of attention shifts
)

# For 3D volumes (e.g., CT/MRI)
from focusnet import EnhancedFocusNet3D
model3d = EnhancedFocusNet3D(
    in_channels=1,
    num_classes=2,
    num_saccades=2
)
```

## Training

Train on any MedMNIST dataset:
```bash
python scripts/train.py --dataset pathmnist --epochs 100
```

Available datasets:
- 2D: pathmnist, chestmnist, dermamnist, octmnist, pneumoniamnist, retinamnist
- 3D: organmnist3d, nodulemnist3d, fracturemnist3d

## Model Architecture

FocusNet's architecture consists of three main components:

1. **M/P/K Pathways**:
   - M (Magnocellular): Processes motion and coarse features
   - P (Parvocellular): Handles fine details and high spatial frequency
   - K (Koniocellular): Specializes in color and orientation

2. **Dynamic Attention**:
   - Learns optimal viewing positions
   - Integrates information across multiple fixations
   - Implements saccadic suppression during attention shifts

3. **Predictive Coding**:
   - GRU-based temporal integration
   - Enhanced memory for multi-saccade sequences
   - Adaptive feature weighting

## Results

Our model achieves superior performance across multiple medical imaging tasks:

| Dataset | Accuracy | AUC-ROC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| PathMNIST | 95.2% | 0.989 |
| ChestMNIST | 91.7% | 0.965 |
| DermaMNIST | 93.4% | 0.978 |
| OrganMNIST3D | 89.8% | 0.952 |

## Visualization

Generate attention visualizations:
```bash
python scripts/visualize.py --model_path results/pathmnist_latest/best_model.pth --dataset pathmnist
```

This produces:
- Attention maps showing model fixation points
- M/P/K pathway feature visualizations
- Receptive field analysis
